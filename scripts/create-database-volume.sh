# one and reuse it. The PostgreSQL instance will be switched to the new
# volume rather than trying to fix the database in the old. The old will
# be left in place to allow forensics to be done if necessary, and to
# avoid potential issues with trying to clear database volume while a
# PostgreSQL instance is still trying to use it.
